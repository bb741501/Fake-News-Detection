Fake News Detection using Passive-Aggressive Classifier
This project demonstrates how to build a simple fake news detection model using Python. The model is trained using the Passive-Aggressive Classifier and evaluates its performance using various metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

Project Structure"
data.csv: The dataset used for training and testing the model. This file should contain news headlines along with their labels (e.g., 0 for fake, 1 for real).

fake_news_detection.py: The main Python script that contains the code for loading data, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

README.md: This documentation file.

Dataset:

The dataset data.csv should be a CSV file with at least two columns:

Headline: The text of the news headline.

Label: The label indicating whether the news is fake (0) or real (1).

Code Explanation:

Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset using pandas and explore its basic properties like shape and column details.

Data Preprocessing:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Use TfidfVectorizer to convert the news headlines into TF-IDF feature vectors.

Model Training:

A PassiveAggressiveClassifier is used as the model for detecting fake news. The model is trained on the TF-IDF vectors of the training data.

Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
The confusion matrix is visualized using Seaborn's heatmap.

Output:

Confusion Matrix: A heatmap visualizing the confusion matrix.
Accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the test data.
Classification Report: Detailed performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
